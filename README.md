# Japanese Card Templates for Anki

Hi,

these are my in-development card templates for learning Japanese with Anki.

They're far from perfect, but feel free to use and modify them.

The goal of my development on the card templates is not to create flawless designs, but to have cards good enough for myself.

## Installtion

Currently there's no convenient way to add the templates. Just copy and paste the content of the bodies of the appropirate HTML files and the content of the css file for styling.

## Known limitations

Drawing on cards does not work with HiDPI scaling options enabled.
