# Japanese Card Templates for Anki

Hi,

these are my in-development card templates for learning Japanese with Anki.

They're far from perfect, but feel free to use and modify them.

The goal of my development on the card templates is not to create flawless designs, but to have cards good enough for myself.

## Installtion

Currently there's no convenient way to add the templates. Just copy and paste the content of the bodies of the appropirate HTML files and the content of the css file for styling.

## Known limitations

Drawing on cards does not work with HiDPI scaling options enabled.

Verb types on the front side of the writing card does not load.

## Fields

### dictionary_form

For the kanji + kana writing

### dictionary_form_kana

For the kana writing. Can be omitted, e. g. if dictionary_form already is kana only.

### translation

The meaningin your preferred language

### type

The type of the word. It is used for displaying additional information. You must use the exact types as me for it to work. The type system might be extended in the future.

Current types in use:

* ichidan-verb
* godan-verb
* irregular-verb
